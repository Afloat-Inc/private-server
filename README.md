# Private Server

Provides the backend services for Private Dpcuments:

- Enables the user to authenticate with the service by sigining a challenge message with the private key related to their on chain account
- Securly stores the user's private cipher key used to encrypt their owned payloads, this key is not the one related to their on chain account.
- Enables the lookup of other users public keys, to enable the sharing of data privately 
- Keeps track of each user's private data and related metadata
- Keeps track of data shares and related metadata

The services provided by this server are called via hasura actions and as such are exposed through the hasura graphql endpoint, some of the most important services are:
